# SignShop
Simple sign shop made with Vault integration.

You make shop by placing signs... Of course you place signs, that's why it's called SignShop you dummy...
Left-click on the sign is for buying items.
Right-clieck on the sign is for selling items.


Well... Let the Help section commence!

Ok, so when you make SignShop sign, everything is going to be black(not being racist... I'm just talking about the color of the text...) you don't need to make it colored... I don't even think that you can make it colored but anyways...
Here you have an example of the sign that you will have to make:

    [SignShop]
     DIAMOND
       5:2
        1

ok, so let me explain above "picture" that I made.
First line is always the same. The text says `[SignShop]` and it's supposed to color blue when you stop editing the sign.
The second line is the material ID of the item you want to sell.
Then you have a complicated `5:2` there... ah well... so the first number is the buy price and the second one is the sell price.
Final but not least, we have a number! And this number is not a normal number, but it is an amount of items being sold or purchased.

That's it. If you find any bugs, please report so I can fix them ASAP.
